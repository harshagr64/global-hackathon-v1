  content: `The first day of high school can be daunting for any teenager, but for one young girl, it marked the beginning of a friendship that would last throughout her school years.

She remembers carefully choosing her outfit that morning - a hand-me-down blue dress that had belonged to her older sister. While the dress was beautiful, it couldn't quite mask the nervousness she felt about starting at a new school where she didn't know a single soul.

Her biggest fear, as she walked through those school doors, was the prospect of sitting alone at lunch. The cafeteria can be an intimidating place for any newcomer, and the thought of eating alone while surrounded by established friend groups was almost overwhelming.

But sometimes, life has a way of surprising us with unexpected kindness. Enter Mary - a girl who noticed her standing alone and made a choice that would change everything. With a simple invitation to join her table, Mary not only solved the immediate lunch crisis but also opened the door to what would become a cherished high school friendship.

That blue dress, which had started as a symbol of hand-me-down uncertainty, became part of a memory that would be treasured for years to come. It reminds us that sometimes our most anxious moments can lead to our most precious connections.`,
  wisdom: [
    "Sometimes the kindness of a stranger can change your entire day, and sometimes your entire life.",
    "The moments we fear the most often lead to the experiences we treasure the most.",
    "A simple act of inclusion can mean the world to someone who feels alone."

    "Ask about Mary - what was she like and how long did their friendship last?",
